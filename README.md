# TTS model for Technical English Vocabulary
# Text-to-Speech Model Training

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for training a text-to-speech (TTS) model. The goal is to fine-tune a pre-trained TTS model to improve speech quality and adapt to specific speaker characteristics.
